# Ionic reader for XML, CSV, TSV

This is tutorial code on re-using Angular http client to read XML, CSV, and TSV files.

This code is based on [this Mastering Ionic blog](http://masteringionic.com/blog/2016-12-18-parsing-xml-csv-and-tsv-files-with-ionic/).

This repo merely updates dependencies from the blog's 2016 versions which are no longer available to July 2019 versions so that the dependencies install and the code compiles.
